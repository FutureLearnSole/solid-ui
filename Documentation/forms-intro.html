<h2>Using solid-ui Forms</h2>

<p>The form system allows you to define a user interface
  declaratively in RDF.
  Then in your web app, you:
  <ol>
    <li>make sure the onology files are loaded,</li>
    <li>load the file with the fom itself, then</li>
    <li>call <tt>UI.widgets.appendForm(dom, container, {}, subject, form, doc, callback)</tt></li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  where
  <table>
    <tr><td>dom</td><td>if the DOM HTMLDocument object, aka document</td></tr>
    <tr><td>container</td><td>is a DOM element to contain the form</td></tr>
    <tr><td>{}</td><td>are unused at present</td></tr>
    <tr><td>subject</td><td>if the RDF thing about which data will be stored</td></tr>
    <tr><td>form</td><td>the an RDF object in the store for the form. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>doc</td><td>The RDF document oin the web where the dat awill be stored. Often, <tt>subject.doc()</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>callback</td><td>is a function taking an errors flag and a message (if the error flag is true)</td></tr>
  </table>
  If the form is a complex form, as the user adds more data, more form UI will be created.
  The data is saved back to the web the moment the users has entered it, in each field. There is no general Save Button.
</p>
<p>
There is a form form for editing forms.
It is in the form onology itsef.
</p>

<p>
You can of course go and write other implementatioons of the form system using
your favorite user interface language.

<h2>Form field types</h2>
<p>Form fields may be named nodes in your file,
or blank nodes... the form system does not mind.
It is often useful to name them to keep track of them.
</p>

<h3>Form</h3>
<p>The form itself has a collection of fields.
The <tt>parts</tt> property gives an order list of
the fields in each form.
For each part, declare its type, and the extra data that type requires, as below.
</p>
  <h3>Group</h3>
<p>Group is a field which is just a collection of other fields.
  It is in fact interchangable with Form.


<h3>Single Value fields - Numeric</h3>

</p>These prompt the user for a  single value.  They typically take default values,
and min and max values.</p>

<h4>BooleanField</h4>
<p>A checkbox on the form, stored an RDF boolean true or false value.</p>

<h4>TriStateField</h4>
<p>A checkbox on the form, stores an RDF boolean true or false value,
  or no value if the box is left in its third, blank state.</p>

<h4>IntegerField</h4>
<p>An RDF integer value</p>

<h4>DecimalField</h4>
<p>An RDF decimal value. Useful for montary amounts</p>

<h4>FloatField</h4>
<p>A floatinhg point number</p>


<h3>Single Value fields: Special Types </h3>

<h4>ColorField</h4>
<p>A color picker is used, and genertes a string which is a CSS_compatible color in
a string like <tt>#ffeebb</tt></p>

<h4>DateField</h4>

<p>Uses a date picker on a good browser.
  Leaves an RDF date literal as is vale.
<h4>DateTimeField</h4>
<p></p>

Leaves an RDF dateTime literal as is value.
<h4>PhoneField</h4>
<p></p>

Leaves as its value a named now with a uri which starts 'tel:'
<h4>EmailField</h4>
<p></p>

Leaves as its value a named now with a uri which starts 'mailto:'

<h3>Single Value fields - Text</h3>

 <h4>SingleLineTextField</h4>
<p></p>

   <h4>MultiLineTextField</h4>
<p></p>

<h3>Complex fields</h3>
<h4>Group</h4>
<p></p>

A group is simply a static set of fields of any type.
It is in fact a nested form.
<h4>Multiple</h4>
<p></p>

<p>When the subject can have several of the same thing,
like friends, ro phone numers, then  the Multiple field
allows this.  The user clicks on the grren plus icon, and is prompted
for a subform for the related thing.
The user can also delete existing ones.</p>
<p>For each new thing, the system generatees an arbitrary (timestamp) URI within the file
where the data is being stored.  The subform is then about that thing: the subject of the subform is not
the subject of the original form. It is the fielnd, or the address, and so on.
</p>
<h4>Classifier</h4>
<p></p>

<p>The classifier pops a menu to allow the user to select a set of valued to classify the subject.
</p>
<h4>Options</h4>
<p></p>

<p>And Optioons field is the 'case statement' of the form system.
  It will chose at runtime a subfield depending
  on a propwrty, often the type, of the subject.   Often used after a classifier.
</p>



<h3>Documentation fields</h3>
<h4>Heading</h4>
<p>Help the user find arts of a oong form, or just for a titke of a short form.</p>

<h4>Comment</h4>
<p>Use comments inthe form to help usres understand what is going on,
what their options are, and what the fields mean.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The form language and the form implementaionin solid-ui
  can't do everyhing, but it can handle
  a pretty wide selection of tasks in common
daily life at home and at work.
It can be vary efficneint as dev elopers can resuse mterial between forms.
Users can even generate their own forms.
